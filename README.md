# Llama-3-8b-unsloth-finetuning-on-4G-anomalie-solutions


## Description

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Llama 3 8B model using the Unsloth framework for solving 4G network anomaly detection challenges. It applies advanced large language model (LLM) techniques to learn patterns and classify network anomalies efficiently. The fine-tuning leverages resource-efficient methods, allowing large-scale model adaptation even on limited hardware setups.
